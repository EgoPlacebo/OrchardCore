Release date: Not yet released

## Breaking Changes

### TheAdmin Theme

The `TheAdmin` theme was upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3.2. Here is a list of the breaking changes

 - The `bg-primary` class was changed to `text-bg-theme`.
 - The `darkmode` theme is now called `dark`.
 - The `default` theme is now called `light`.
 - By default, the theme is set to `auto` which allows us to use the default device color preference.
 - Metrial-icons are no longer included.
 - The `DarkModeService.cs` was replaced with `ThemeTogglerService`.
 - The property named `DisplayDarkMode` in `AdminSettings` was replaced with `DisplayThemeToggler`.
 - Bootstrap is no longer compiled in `TheAdmin.css`. Bootstrap assets are loaded independently for performance and maintainability reasons.

 ### Navbar

 The `NavbarTop` zone is no longer used in the `TheAdmin` or `TheTheme` themes. Follow the Navbar details below on how to inject custom menu items in the navbar.

## Change Logs

### TheTheme Theme

The `TheTheme` theme was upgraded to Bootstrap 5.3.2. New `light` and `dark` modes were added.

### Navbar

The upper navigation bar has been transformed into a customizable shape, allowing for easy integration of items. The `NavbarTop` zone is no longer used in the `TheAdmin` or `TheTheme` themes. If you wish to add a menu item to the navigation bar, simply create a display driver for `Navbar`. 

As an illustration, we inject the theme toggler into both `Detail` and `DetailAdmin` display type using a display driver as outlined below:

```csharp
public class ToggleThemeNavbarDisplayDriver : DisplayDriver<Navbar>
{
    public override IDisplayResult Display(Navbar model)
    {
        return View("ToggleTheme", model)
            .Location("Detail", "Content:10")
            .Location("DetailAdmin", "Content:10");
    }
}
```

 Additionally, the follow shapes have been removed
 - `ContentCulturePickerContainer`
 - `AdminCulturePickerContainer`
